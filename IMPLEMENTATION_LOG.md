# Pure IB Verbs Implementation Log
**Started**: August 12, 2025  
**Purpose**: Track implementation progress, decisions, and learnings

---

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept ✅
**Status**: COMPLETED  
**Date**: 2025-08-12  

**What we proved:**
- Pure IB verbs can open device directly without RDMA CM
- QP creation works with `ibv_create_qp()`
- State transitions (INIT→RTR→RTS) accept custom PSN values
- PSN control verified: local=0x123456, remote=0x789abc

**Key Learning:**
- RoCE requires GID exchange (16 bytes)
- Must query and set GID for Ethernet-based RDMA
- Port 1 is standard default

## Core Decisions Made

### Decision 1: No RDMA CM at All
**Date**: 2025-08-12  
**Rationale**: RDMA CM's `rdma_connect/accept` automatically transitions QP to RTS, preventing custom PSN control.  
**Impact**: Must handle all device management and QP creation manually.

### Decision 2: TLS-First Connection
**Date**: 2025-08-12  
**Rationale**: Security requirement - PSN must be exchanged over encrypted channel.  
**Impact**: All RDMA parameters exchanged after TLS handshake.

### Decision 3: Per-Client IB Resources
**Date**: 2025-08-12  
**Rationale**: Each client needs independent QP with unique PSN.  
**Impact**: Server creates new QP for each TLS connection.

## Technical Findings

### Finding 1: QP State Machine
```
RESET → INIT → RTR → RTS → (Ready for operations)
         ↑      ↑     ↑
         |      |     └── Set local PSN (sq_psn)
         |      └──────── Set remote PSN (rq_psn)
         └─────────────── Set port, pkey, access flags
```

### Finding 2: Required Parameters for RTR
For RoCE (Ethernet):
- `dest_qp_num`: Remote QP number
- `rq_psn`: Remote PSN (custom value)
- `ah_attr.grh.dgid`: Remote GID (16 bytes)
- `ah_attr.grh.sgid_index`: Local GID index
- `path_mtu`: Maximum transfer unit

### Finding 3: Memory Registration
- Must register memory regions with `ibv_reg_mr()`
- Protection domain must match QP's PD
- Access flags determine RDMA permissions

## Code Snippets for Reference

### Opening IB Device
```c
struct ibv_device **dev_list = ibv_get_device_list(&num_devices);
struct ibv_context *ctx = ibv_open_device(dev_list[0]);
ibv_free_device_list(dev_list);
```

### Creating QP
```c
struct ibv_qp_init_attr qp_attr = {
    .send_cq = send_cq,
    .recv_cq = recv_cq,
    .qp_type = IBV_QPT_RC,
    .cap = {
        .max_send_wr = 10,
        .max_recv_wr = 10,
        .max_send_sge = 1,
        .max_recv_sge = 1
    }
};
struct ibv_qp *qp = ibv_create_qp(pd, &qp_attr);
```

### Setting Custom PSN
```c
// RTR state - set remote PSN
attr.rq_psn = remote_psn_from_tls;

// RTS state - set local PSN  
attr.sq_psn = local_psn_from_tls;
```

## Testing Results

### Test 1: Pure IB Proof of Concept
**Date**: 2025-08-12  
**Result**: ✅ SUCCESS  
**Details**: QP transitions work with custom PSN values

---

## Next Actions

1. **Immediate**: Clean up server code to remove RDMA CM
2. **Next**: Implement device manager singleton
3. **Then**: Create per-client QP factory
4. **Finally**: Test end-to-end connection

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **RDMA CM is convenient but restrictive** - Hides important details and limits control
2. **Pure IB verbs give complete control** - More code but full flexibility
3. **State transitions are critical** - Must happen in correct order with right parameters
4. **GID is essential for RoCE** - Unlike InfiniBand which uses LID

## Phase 3: Multi-Client Optimization
**Date**: 2025-08-13  
**Status**: IN PROGRESS

### Shared Device Context Implementation ✅
**Problem Identified**: Each client was opening its own device context (`ibv_open_device`), causing:
- Resource waste (multiple contexts to same device)
- Potential driver limitations
- Inefficient memory usage

**Solution Implemented**: Shared device context architecture
- Server opens device context once during initialization
- All clients share the same device context
- Each client maintains its own:
  - Protection Domain (PD)
  - Queue Pair (QP)
  - Completion Queues (CQs)
  - Memory Regions (MRs)

**Code Changes**:
1. Added `struct ibv_context *device_ctx` to `server_context`
2. Open device in `init_server()` once: `server->device_ctx = ibv_open_device(dev_list[0])`
3. Modified `client_handler_thread()` to use: `ctx = client->server->device_ctx`
4. Updated cleanup: Clients don't close context, server does in `cleanup_server()`

**Benefits**:
- Reduced resource consumption
- Better scalability for multi-client scenarios
- Cleaner resource management model
- No more per-client device opens

### Multi-Client Test Results (Initial)
**Date**: 2025-08-13  
**Test Configuration**: 13 clients total (3 sequential, 5 concurrent, 5 stress)
**Results**:
- Successful: 10 clients
- Failed: 3 clients (hit MAX_CLIENTS limit)
- PSN uniqueness: ✅ All PSN values unique
- Server stability: ✅ No crashes

**Issues Found**:
- MAX_CLIENTS limit (10) reached
- Need better client slot management
- Consider dynamic client array


### Multi-Client Test Results (With Shared Device Context)
**Date**: 2025-08-13  
**Test Configuration**: 13 clients total (3 sequential, 5 concurrent, 5 stress)
**Server Changes**: Implemented shared device context

**Results**:
- Successful connections: 10 clients (1-9, 11)
- Failed connections: 3 clients (10, 12, 13) - hit MAX_CLIENTS limit
- PSN uniqueness: ✅ All 10 successful clients have unique PSN values
- Server stability: ✅ No crashes, clean shutdown
- Resource efficiency: ✅ Single device context shared by all clients

**Verified PSN Values**:
- Client 1: PSN 0x121e5f
- Client 2: PSN 0xfbe77d
- Client 3: PSN 0x8763ed
- Client 4: PSN 0x9e9a8b
- Client 5: PSN 0xe6fd55
- Client 6: PSN 0xf9e2b1
- Client 7: PSN 0x81424d
- Client 8: PSN 0x4364a1
- Client 9: PSN 0x44cbb9
- Client 11: PSN 0x59b0b5

**Key Achievement**: Server log shows "Opened shared RDMA device: rxe0" once at startup, and all clients report "Using shared RDMA device rxe0", confirming the optimization is working.


### Thread Safety Verification ✅
**Date**: 2025-08-13  
**Test Type**: Concurrent stress testing

**Test Scenarios**:
1. 10 truly simultaneous connections
2. Rapid fire connections (no delay)
3. Connection cycling (connect/disconnect patterns)

**Results**:
- Total attempts: 25 clients
- Successful: 10 clients (server MAX_CLIENTS limit)
- PSN uniqueness: ✅ 10 unique PSNs out of 10 successful
- Server errors: 0
- Thread safety issues: 0
- Maximum concurrent: 10/10

**Key Findings**:
- No race conditions in PSN generation
- Mutex protection working correctly for client slots
- No deadlocks or thread safety issues detected
- Server handles simultaneous connections properly
- Clean resource management under stress
