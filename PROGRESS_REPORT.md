# RDMA Implementation Progress Report
**Date**: August 12, 2025
**Status**: Partially Working

## Completed Tasks ‚úÖ

1. **Removed RDMA CM Connection Management**
   - Successfully removed `rdma_connect()` from client
   - Successfully removed `rdma_accept()` from server
   - Eliminated RDMA listener thread that was waiting for CONNECT_REQUEST events

2. **Implemented Manual QP State Transitions**
   - Added proper INIT‚ÜíRTR‚ÜíRTS transitions with custom PSN values
   - Client sets remote PSN during RTR transition
   - Server sets local PSN during RTS transition

3. **Direct RDMA Device Access**
   - Server now opens RDMA device directly using `ibv_open_device()`
   - Creates QP using `ibv_create_qp()` instead of `rdma_create_qp()`
   - No dependency on RDMA CM for QP creation

4. **Fixed Server Architecture**
   - QP creation happens immediately after TLS connection
   - No waiting for RDMA CM events
   - All RDMA resources created in client handler thread

## Current Issues üîß

1. **Client-Server Synchronization**
   - Client still uses RDMA CM for address/route resolution
   - Server uses direct IB verbs
   - Mismatch in approach causing connection issues

2. **Parameter Exchange**
   - RDMA parameters exchange over TLS partially working
   - Timing issues between client and server
   - Client expects server to be ready immediately after TLS

3. **Segmentation Faults**
   - Both client and server experiencing crashes
   - Likely due to incomplete resource initialization
   - Need better error handling

## Architecture Decisions Made

### Why Remove RDMA CM Connection Functions?
- `rdma_connect()` and `rdma_accept()` automatically transition QP to RTS
- This prevents setting custom PSN values for security
- Manual QP management gives us complete control

### Why Direct Device Access on Server?
- RDMA CM requires connection events that we're not generating
- Direct IB verbs bypass the connection state machine
- Allows immediate QP creation after TLS connection

### Current Flow
```
1. Client ‚Üí TLS Connect ‚Üí Server
2. PSN Exchange over TLS ‚úÖ
3. Server creates QP directly ‚úÖ
4. Client creates QP via RDMA CM ‚úÖ
5. Parameter exchange over TLS ‚ö†Ô∏è (partial)
6. Manual QP transitions ‚úÖ
7. RDMA operations ‚ùå (not reached)
```

## Key Learnings

1. **RDMA CM is All-or-Nothing**
   - Cannot selectively use parts of RDMA CM
   - Either use full connection management or none at all

2. **QP State Management**
   - QP must be in INIT before setting access flags
   - Must transition to RTR with remote PSN
   - Must transition to RTS with local PSN

3. **Device Context Required**
   - All RDMA operations need valid device context
   - Can get from RDMA CM or direct device open
   - Mixing approaches causes issues

## Next Steps

1. **Unify Approach**
   - Either both use RDMA CM (with workaround for PSN)
   - Or both use direct IB verbs (more complex but full control)

2. **Fix Synchronization**
   - Add proper handshaking after QP creation
   - Ensure both sides ready before parameter exchange

3. **Add Error Recovery**
   - Better error messages
   - Graceful cleanup on failure
   - Connection retry logic

## Recommendation

Consider using **pure IB verbs on both sides** without any RDMA CM. This would:
- Give complete control over connection establishment
- Allow custom PSN values at the right time
- Eliminate dependency on RDMA CM events
- Require manual address resolution but provide full flexibility

The current hybrid approach (RDMA CM on client, direct verbs on server) is causing compatibility issues and should be unified.
