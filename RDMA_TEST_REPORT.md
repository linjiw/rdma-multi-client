# RDMA Implementation Test Report
**Date**: August 12, 2025
**AWS Instance**: ip-172-31-34-15

## Executive Summary
Testing revealed critical bugs in the RDMA server implementation that prevent successful client-server communication. While the TLS-based PSN exchange works correctly, the RDMA connection establishment fails due to missing QP creation on the server side.

## Test Environment
- **Platform**: AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance
- **RDMA**: Soft-RoCE (rxe0 device) 
- **Network**: 172.31.34.15/20
- **State**: RDMA modules loaded, device active

## Key Findings

### 1. ✅ RDMA Environment Configuration
- Soft-RoCE device (rxe0) is properly configured and active
- All required kernel modules loaded (rdma_rxe, ib_core, etc.)
- Libraries linked correctly (libibverbs, librdmacm)

### 2. ✅ Build System
- Code compiles successfully with minor warnings
- TLS certificate generation works
- Both server and client binaries build correctly

### 3. ✅ TLS-PSN Exchange
- TLS handshake establishes successfully on port 4433
- PSN generation and exchange works correctly
- Both client and server generate unique PSNs

### 4. ❌ CRITICAL BUG: Server Missing QP Creation
**Location**: `src/secure_rdma_server.c:handle_rdma_connection()`

**Issue**: The server never calls `rdma_create_qp()` before accepting connections. It attempts to use `client->cm_id->qp` which is NULL, causing a segmentation fault.

**Impact**: Server crashes when attempting to access QP properties during RDMA parameter exchange.

**Required Fix**:
```c
// In handle_rdma_connection(), before rdma_accept():
struct ibv_qp_init_attr qp_attr;
memset(&qp_attr, 0, sizeof(qp_attr));
qp_attr.send_cq = ibv_create_cq(id->verbs, 10, NULL, NULL, 0);
qp_attr.recv_cq = ibv_create_cq(id->verbs, 10, NULL, NULL, 0);
qp_attr.qp_type = IBV_QPT_RC;
qp_attr.cap.max_send_wr = 10;
qp_attr.cap.max_recv_wr = 10;
qp_attr.cap.max_send_sge = 1;
qp_attr.cap.max_recv_sge = 1;

if (rdma_create_qp(id, NULL, &qp_attr)) {
    perror("rdma_create_qp");
    return -1;
}
```

### 5. ⚠️ RDMA Parameter Exchange Timing
**Issue**: Even after fixing QP creation, there's a timing issue where the client tries to exchange RDMA parameters immediately after PSN exchange, but the server might not have accepted the RDMA connection yet.

**Current Flow**:
1. Client connects via TLS, exchanges PSN
2. Client establishes RDMA connection
3. Client immediately tries to exchange RDMA params
4. Server might still be processing the connection request

### 6. ⚠️ Resource Management
- No proper cleanup in error paths
- Memory regions not properly deregistered on disconnect
- Potential resource leaks with multiple client connections

## Test Results Summary

| Test Category | Status | Notes |
|--------------|--------|-------|
| Environment Setup | ✅ PASS | Soft-RoCE configured correctly |
| Build System | ✅ PASS | Compiles with warnings |
| TLS Handshake | ✅ PASS | Port 4433 working |
| PSN Exchange | ✅ PASS | Unique PSNs generated |
| RDMA Connection | ❌ FAIL | Server segfault on QP access |
| Parameter Exchange | ❌ FAIL | Never reached due to crash |
| Multi-client | ❌ NOT TESTED | Blocked by server crash |
| Performance | ❌ NOT TESTED | Blocked by connection issues |

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes Required:
1. **Add QP creation in server** - Critical for basic functionality
2. **Fix RDMA parameter exchange synchronization** - Ensure proper ordering
3. **Add error handling** - Prevent crashes, handle edge cases
4. **Implement proper cleanup** - Prevent resource leaks

### Testing Improvements:
1. Add unit tests for individual components
2. Create integration tests for connection flow
3. Add stress tests for multi-client scenarios
4. Implement automated regression testing

### Code Quality:
1. Fix all compiler warnings
2. Add comprehensive logging
3. Implement proper error codes
4. Add documentation for RDMA flow

## Conclusion
The implementation has the correct architecture and security design (TLS-based PSN exchange), but critical bugs in the RDMA connection establishment prevent it from functioning. The primary issue is the missing QP creation on the server side, which causes an immediate crash when clients connect.

Once the QP creation is added and the parameter exchange timing is fixed, the implementation should work correctly for basic RDMA operations. Further testing will be needed for multi-client support and performance validation.
