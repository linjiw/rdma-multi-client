# Project Summary - Secure RDMA with Pure IB Verbs

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented a **secure RDMA communication system** using pure InfiniBand verbs that solves the critical security vulnerability where RDMA Connection Manager prevents custom PSN control, making systems vulnerable to replay attacks.

## Problem Statement

    subgraph "The Problem"
        P1[RDMA CM Issue]
        P2[rdma_accept/connect]
        P3[Auto-transitions to RTS]
        P4[Cannot set custom PSN]
        P5[Replay Attack Risk]
        
        P1 --> P2
        P2 --> P3
        P3 --> P4
        P4 --> P5
        
        style P5 fill:#f99,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px
    end
```

**Impact**: Systems using RDMA CM cannot implement secure PSN exchange, leaving them vulnerable to packet replay attacks.
